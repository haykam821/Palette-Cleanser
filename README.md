Recaches the block state palette used in debug mode worlds in order to add modded blocks.

Palette Cleanser requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

## Installation

1. Download Palette Cleanser from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/palette-cleanser/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Palette-Cleanser/releases).
2. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

When this mod is installed, the palette of block states used to generate the debug world will be recalculated when a new debug world chunk generator is constructed. This causes modded blocks that are normally registered after the debug world block state palette is created to appear in the debug world.
